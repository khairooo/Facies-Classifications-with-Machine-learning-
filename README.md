# Facies-Classifications-with-Machine-learning-
Facies Classifcation using Well Datasets 
- This project was created using Machine Learning Algorithms (supervised claasification ), to predict the strata in different adjacent wells ( Oil and gas exploitation )
- The main purpose of this project is to provide an advanced way to predict the layers in the underground earth, whithout the high cost of drilling, using Geophysical Data
